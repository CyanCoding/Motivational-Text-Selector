# Motivational Text Selector
This is a handy program in C# that will read from the provided JSON file
and output the quote and auther into two `string` variables, `quote` and
`author` (very intuitive naming scheme).

This can be used in a wide range of areas, such as a daily motivation toast
notification on your desktop, a text display in your app, or a positive daily
email. The original list of quotes and basis of this program was inspired by
the gist from [@Signed0](https://gist.github.com/signed0). Check that out [here](https://gist.github.com/signed0/d70780518341e1396e11).
I copied his `json` and added several more quotes. Then I created the C# integration.
If you are using Python, be sure to check out his gist because he has a code sample there.
